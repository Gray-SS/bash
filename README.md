Minish is a lightweight, custom-built Unix shell written in C. It supports essential shell functionalities including command parsing, execution, basic job control, prompt customization, and input editing with persistent command history via `readline`.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Customizable Prompt**
  Displays username, hostname, current working directory, and command status (✓ / ✗).

- 🔁 **Command Parsing**
  Handles arguments.

- 📜 **Command History**
  Uses GNU `readline` to support:

  - Arrow key navigation
  - Persistent history saved in `~/.myshell_history`
  - In-line editing

- ⚙️ **Basic Command Execution**
  Runs external programs and shell built-ins (like `cd` or `exit`).

- 🔒 **Root Detection**
  Shows `#` in the prompt if the user is root, `$` otherwise.
